==Transcript==
:'''Shrek''': ''"Once upon a time, there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle, guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from the dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss."'' [Laughing] Like that's ever gonna happen.

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin', and they don't stop comin', fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin', didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets. You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now, you're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now, you're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold, only shootin' stars break the mold. It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder, you're bundled up now, but wait till you get older. But the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin, the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey, now, you're an all-star. ♪

:'''Shrek''': [Laughs] Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres-- they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
:'''Villager 3''': No!
:'''Shrek''': They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

:'''Captain of the Guards''': By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest, and transport you to a designated, resettlement facility.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, really? You and what army?
:[Gasps, Whimpering]
:'''Donkey''': [Chuckles] Can I say somethin' to you? Listen, you was really, really somethin' back there. Incredible!
:'''Shrek''': Are you talkin' to-- me? Whoa!
:'''Donkey''': Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you was great back there? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, then bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babies in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, that's great. Really.
:'''Donkey''': Man, it's good to be free.
:'''Shrek''': Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
:'''Donkey''': But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
:[Roaring]
:'''Donkey''': Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time-- [Mumbling] Then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day.
:'''Shrek''': Why are you following me?
:'''Donkey''': I'll tell you why. ♪ 'Cause I'm all alone. There's no one here beside me. My problems have all gone, there's no one to deride me. But you gotta have friends-- ♪
:'''Shrek''': Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.
:'''Donkey''': Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
:'''Shrek''': Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?
:'''Donkey''': Uh-- Really tall?
:'''Shrek''': No! I'm an ogre. You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?
:'''Donkey''': Nope.
:'''Shrek''': Really?
:'''Donkey''': Really, really.
:'''Shrek''': Oh.
:'''Donkey''': Man, I like you. What's your name?
:'''Shrek''': Uh, Shrek.
:'''Donkey''': Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. Who'd want to live in a place like that?
:'''Shrek''': That would be my home.
:'''Donkey''': Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?
:'''Shrek''': I like my privacy.
:'''Donkey''': You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. You know. Can I stay with you?
:'''Shrek''': Uh, what?
:'''Donkey''': Can I stay with you? Please?
:'''Shrek''': Of course!
:'''Donkey''': Really?
:'''Shrek''': No.
:'''Donkey''': Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But, that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
:'''Shrek''': Okay! Okay! But one night only.
:'''Donkey''': Ah! Thank you!
:'''Shrek''': What are you-- No. No.
:'''Donkey''': This is gonna be fun. We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin', I'm makin' waffles.
:'''Shrek''': Oh!
:'''Donkey''': Where do, uh, I sleep?
:'''Shrek''': Outside!
:'''Donkey''': Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, I guess outside is best. [Sniffles] Here I go. Good night. [Sighs] I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself. Outside, I guess. You know. By myself. Outside. ♪ I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me. ♪

:'''Donkey''': Hey, don’t look at me. I didn't invite them.
:'''Pinocchio''': Gosh, no one invited us.
:'''Shrek''': What?
:'''Pinocchio''': We were forced to come here.
:'''Shrek''': By who?
:'''Pig''': Lord Farquaad. He huffed und he puffed und he singed an eviction notice.
:'''Shrek''': [Sighs] All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is.

:'''Donkey''': Oh, I do. I know where he is.

:'''Donkey''': Me! Me! Oh! Oh! Pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

:'''Mirror''': Well, technically you're not a king.
:'''Farquaad''': Uh, Thelonius. You were saying
:'''Mirror''': What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.
:'''Farquaad''': Go on.
:'''Mirror''': [Chuckles] So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome, Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! And last, but certainly not the least, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead, from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But, don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! So will it be, bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two, or bachelorette number three?
:'''Guards''': Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!
:'''Farquaad''': Three? One? [Shudders] Three?

:'''Shrek''': And the squatters?
:'''Farquaad''': As good as gone.
:'''Shrek''': What kind of quest?
:'''Donkey''': Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon, and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp, which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
:'''Shrek''': You know what? Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.
:'''Donkey''': I don't get it, Shrek. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread. The whole ogre trip.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village, and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?
:'''Donkey''': Uh, no, not really, no.
:'''Shrek''': For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.
:'''Donkey''': Example?
:'''Shrek''': Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
:'''Donkey''': [Sniffs] They stink?
:'''Shrek''': Yes-- No!
:'''Donkey''': They make you cry?
:'''Shrek''': No!
:'''Donkey''': You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.
:'''Shrek''': No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. [Sighs]
:'''Donkey''': Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [Sniffs] You know, not everybody likes onions. Cakes! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
:'''Shrek''': I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres. Are not. Like cakes.
:'''Donkey''': You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Hey, let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.
:'''Shrek''': No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
:'''Donkey''': Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole dang planet.
:'''Shrek''': You know, I think preferred your humming.

:'''Shrek''': No, But-- Shh.
:'''Donkey''': Oh, good. Me neither. [Gasps] 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. [Gasps]
:'''Shrek''': Donkey, two things, okay? Shut... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
:'''Donkey''': Stairs? I thought I was lookin' for the princess.
:'''Shrek''': The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
:'''Donkey''': What makes it you think she'll be there?
:'''Shrek''': I read it in a book once.
:'''Donkey''': Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt, too. Those stairs won't know which way they're going.
:[Creaking]
:'''Donkey''': Gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here, right here. I'd step all over it.
:'''Shrek''': Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the--?

:[Growls]
:'''Donkey''': I mean, I mean, white sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're-- You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 'Cause, you're just reeking a feminine beauty. What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ooh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but, you know, I'm, uh-- [Coughs] I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings and stuff. Shrek! [Gasps] [Whimpering] No! Shrek!

:'''Fiona''': I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Oh, that's nice. Now, let's go!
:'''Fiona''': But, wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?
:'''Shrek in Amror''': Yeah. Sorry, lady. There's no time.
:'''Fiona''': Hey, wait. What are you doing? You know, you should sweep me off my feet, out yonder window, and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?
:'''Fiona''': Mm-hmm. [Screams, Grunts] But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
:'''Shrek in Armor''': I don't think so.
:'''Fiona''': Can I at least know the name of my champion?
:'''Shrek''': Um, Shrek.
:'''Fiona''': Sir Shrek. [Clears Throat] I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Thanks.

:'''Fiona''': You didn't slay the dragon?
:'''Shrek in Armor''': It's on my to-do list. Now, come on!
:'''Fiona''': [Screams] But this isn't right! You’re meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying! That's what all the other knights did!
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Yeah, right before they burst into flame!
:'''Fiona''': You know, that's not the point! Oh! Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Well, I have to save my ass.
:'''Fiona''': What kind of knight are you?
:'''Shrek in Armor''': One of the kind.
:'''Donkey''': Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. [Laughs] I don't to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this-- Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude-- Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or maybe his pen pals. 'Cause I'm the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards, and-- I'd really love to stay, but-- Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal ail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission to-- Wait. What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no! No! Oh!

:[Clears Throat]
:'''Fiona''': And where would be a brave knight be without his noble steed?
:'''Donkey''': All right, I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a noble steed.
:'''Fiona''': [Fiona Laughs] The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Uh, no.
:'''Fiona''': Why not?
:'''Shrek''': I have helmet hair.
:'''Fiona''': Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
:'''Shrek in Armor''': No, no, you wouldn't'st.
:'''Fiona''': But, how will you kiss me?
:'''Shrek in Armor''': What? That job wasn't in the job description.
:'''Donkey''': Maybe it's a perk.
:'''Fiona''': No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon, is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
:'''Donkey''': Hmm? With Shrek? You think-- Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is your true love?
:'''Fiona''': Well, yes.
:[Laughing]
:[Laughing]
:'''Donkey''': You think Shrek is your true love!
:'''Fiona''': What is so funny?
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?
:'''Fiona''': Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now-- Now remove your helmet.
:'''Shrek in Amror''': Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
:'''Fiona''': Just take off the helmet.
:'''Shrek in Amror''': I'm not going to.
:'''Fiona''': Take it off.
:'''Shrek in Amror''': No!
:'''Fiona''': Now!
:'''Shrek in Armor''': Okay! Easy. As you command, Your Highness.
:'''Fiona''': You-- You're-- an ogre.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
:'''Fiona''': Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre.
:'''Shrek''': Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay. He's the one who wants to marry you.
:'''Fiona''': Then why didn't he come to rescue me?
:'''Shrek''': Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
:'''Fiona''': But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some ogre and his pet.
:'''Donkey''': So much for noble steed.
:'''Shrek''': You're not making my job any easier.
:'''Fiona''': I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.
:'''Shrek''': Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.
:'''Fiona''': You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
:'''Shrek''': Ya comin', Donkey?
:'''Donkey''': I'm right behind ya.
:'''Fiona''': Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! [Screams]
:'''Donkey''': Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right? But you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?
:'''Fiona''': You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your-- Hey! [Sighs] The sooner we get to Duloc the better.
:'''Donkey''': Oh, yeah. You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!
:'''Fiona''': And my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?
:'''Shrek''': Well, let me put this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's standards are in short supply. [Laughs]
:'''Donkey''': I don't know, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.
:[Both Laughing]
:'''Fiona''': Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
:'''Shrek''': Maybe. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.
:'''Fiona''': Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
:'''Shrek''': No, that'll take longer.
:'''Fiona''': But there's robbers in the woods.
:'''Donkey''': Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping definitely is startin' to sound good.
:'''Shrek''': Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
:'''Fiona''': I need to find somewhere to camp now!
:[Bird Wings Fluttering]
:'''Shrek''': [Grunting] Hey! Over here.
:'''Donkey''': Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.
:'''Fiona''': No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
:'''Shrek''': Homey touches? Like what?
:[Crashing]
:'''Fiona''': A door. Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.
:'''Donkey''': You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
:'''Fiona''': I said, good night!
:'''Donkey''': Shrek, what are you doing?
:'''Shrek''': [Laughs] I just-- You know-- Oh, come on. I was just kidding.
:[Fire Crackling]
:'''Shrek''': Over there. That's Throwback, the only ogre ever to spit over three wheat fields.
:'''Donkey''': Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?
:'''Shrek''': The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.
:'''Donkey''': I know you're making this up.
:'''Shrek''': No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.
:'''Donkey''': Man, ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
:'''Shrek''': Sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
:'''Donkey''': [Sighs] Shrek. What we gonna do, when we get our swamp anyway?
:'''Shrek''': Our swamp?
:'''Donkey''': You know, when we're through with rescuing the princess.
:'''Shrek''': We? Donkey, there is no "we." There's no "our." There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
:'''Donkey''': You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
:'''Shrek''': No. Ya think?
:'''Donkey''': Are you hidin' something?
:'''Shrek''': Never mind, Donkey.
:'''Donkey''': This is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
:'''Shrek''': No, this is one of those drop-it-and-leave-it-alone things.
:'''Donkey''': Why don't you want to talk about it?
:'''Shrek''': Why do you always want to?
:'''Donkey''': Why are you blocking?
:'''Shrek''': I'm not blocking.
:'''Donkey''': Yes, you are.
:'''Shrek''': Donkey, I'm warning you.
:'''Donkey''': Who you trying to keep out?
:'''Shrek''': Everyone! Okay?
:'''Donkey''': Now we're getting somewhere.
:'''Shrek''': For the love of Pete!
:'''Donkey''': What exactly is your problem? What do you got against the world?
:'''Shrek''': I'm not the one with the problem. It's the world that seems to have a problem. People take one look at me and go, "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly, ogre!" [Sighs] They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.
:'''Donkey''': You know? When we met, I didn't think you were just a big, stupid, ugly, ogre.
:'''Shrek''': Yeah.
:'''Donkey''': So, are there any Donkeys up there?
:'''Shrek''': There's Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

:'''Fiona''': I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
:'''Donkey''': But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.
:'''Fiona''': Shrek?
:'''Shrek''': Princess, I-- Uh, how's going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh-- [Sighs] I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.
:'''Fiona''': I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
:[Deep Sigh]
:'''Fiona''': Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.
:'''Donkey''': You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
:'''Fiona''': No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.
:'''Donkey''': What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
:'''Fiona''': Promise you won't tell. Promise!
:'''Donkey''': All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.
:[Door Opens]
:[Snoring]
:'''Fiona''': I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want--
:[Snoring]
:'''Fiona''': Shrek. Are you all right?
:'''Shrek''': Perfect! Never been better.
:'''Fiona''': I-- I don't-- There's something I have to tell you.
:'''Shrek''': You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night.
:'''Fiona''': You heard what I said?
:'''Shrek''': Every word.
:'''Fiona''': I thought you'd understand.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
:'''Fiona''': But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
:'''Shrek''': Yeah? Well, it does.
:[Gasps, Sighs]
:'''Shrek''': Ah, right on time.
:[Horse Whinnies]
:'''Shrek''': Princess, I've brought you a little something.
:♪♪ [Fanfare]
:'''Donkey''': [Yawns] What'd I miss? What'd I miss? [Muffled] Who said that? Couldn't have been the Donkey.
:'''Farquaad''': Princess Fiona.
:'''Shrek''': As promised. Now hand it over.
:'''Farquaad''': Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, ad agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have ever seen such a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad.
:'''Fiona''': Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying, a short, farewell.
:'''Farquaad''': That's so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.
:'''Fiona''': No, you're right. It doesn't.
:'''Farquaad''': Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.
:[Gasps]
:'''Farquaad''': Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
:'''Fiona''': Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make.
:'''Farquaad''': Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
:'''Fiona''': No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets.
:'''Farquaad''': Oh, anxious, are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests!
:'''Fiona''': Fare-thee-well, ogre.
:'''Donkey''': Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.
:'''Shrek''': Yeah? So what?
:'''Donkey''': Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. I talked to her last night.
:'''Shrek''': I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?
:'''Donkey''': Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you.
:'''Shrek''': I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking, Donkeys!
:'''Donkey''': But, I thought--
:'''Shrek''': Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong!
:'''Donkey''': Shrek.

:'''John Cale''': ♪ I heard there was a secret chord, that David played, and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music, do ya? It goes like this the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall the major lift. The baffled king composing hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Baby, I've been here before, I know this room I've walked this floor, I used to live alone before I knew you. I've seen your flag on the marble arch, but love is not a victory march. It's a cold and it's broken hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. And all I ever learned from love is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you. ♪
:[Moaning]
:'''John Cale''': ♪ And it's not a cry you can hear at night, it's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. ♪

:'''Shrek''': Donkey?
:[Grunts]
:'''Shrek''': What are you doing?
:'''Donkey''': I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you saw one.
:'''Shrek''': But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
:'''Donkey''': It is. Around your half. See, that's your half, and this is my half.
:'''Shrek''': Oh! Your half. Hmm.
:'''Donkey''': Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
:'''Shrek''': Back off!
:'''Donkey''': No, you back off.
:'''Shrek''': This is my swamp!
:'''Donkey''': Our swamp.
:'''Shrek''': Let go, Donkey!
:'''Donkey''': You let go.
:'''Shrek''': Stubborn jackass!
:'''Donkey''': Smelly ogre.
:'''Shrek''': Fine!
:'''Donkey''': Hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.
:'''Shrek''': Well, I'm through with you.
:'''Donkey''': Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
:'''Shrek''': Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
:'''Donkey''': Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
:'''Shrek''': Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you, for stabbin' me in the back!
:'''Donkey''': Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.
:'''Shrek''': Go away!
:'''Donkey''': There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you. Maybe even love you.
:'''Shrek''': Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking.
:'''Donkey''': She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
:'''Shrek''': She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?
:'''Donkey''': Uh-uh. No way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?
:'''Shrek''': Donkey!
:'''Donkey''': No!
:'''Shrek''': Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?
:'''Donkey''': Hmph.
:'''Shrek''': [Sighs] I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly, ogre. Can you forgive me?
:'''Donkey''': Hey, that's what friends are for. Right?
:'''Shrek''': Right. Friends?
:'''Donkey''': Friends.
:'''Shrek''': So, what did Fiona say about me?
:'''Donkey''': What are you asking me for? Why don't you ask her?
:'''Shrek''': The wedding! We'll never make it in time.
:'''Donkey''': Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way, and I have a way. [Whistles]
:'''Shrek''': Donkey?
:[Donkey Laughing]
:'''Donkey''': I guess it's just an animal magnetism.
:'''Shrek''': [Laughing] Aw, come here, you.
:'''Donkey''': All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet. [Donkey Laughing] Whoo!

:'''Bishop''': People of Duloc, we gather here today, to bear witness, to the union...
:'''Fiona''': Um-- of our now king--
:'''Bishop''': Excuse me.
:'''Fiona''': Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?
:'''Farquaad''': [Chuckling] Go on.
:'''Donkey''': Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?
:'''Shrek''': What are you talking about?
:'''Donkey''': There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"
:'''Shrek''': I don't have time for this!
:'''Donkey''': Wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?
:'''Shrek''': Yes.
:'''Donkey''': You wanna hold her?
:'''Shrek''': Yes.
:'''Donkey''': Please her?
:'''Shrek''': Yes!
:'''Donkey''': ♪ Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. ♪ The chicks love that romantic crap!

:'''Bishop''': And so, by the power vested in me...
:'''Shrek''': What do you see?
:'''Donkey''': The whole town's in there.
:'''Bishop''': I now pronounce you husband and wife...
:'''Donkey''': They're at the altar.
:'''Bishop''': King and Queen.
:'''Donkey''': Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
:'''Shrek''': Oh! For the love of Pete!
:[Grunts]
:'''Shrek''': I object!
:'''Fiona''': Shrek?
:[Gasps]
:'''Farquaad''': Oh, now what does he want?
:[Crowd Clamoring]
:'''Shrek''': Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.
:'''Fiona''': What are you doing here?
:'''Farquaad''': Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding--
:'''Shrek''': Fiona! I need to talk to you.
:'''Fiona''': Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--
:'''Shrek''': But you can't marry him.
:'''Fiona''': And why not?
:'''Shrek''': Because-- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
:'''Farquaad''': Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
:'''Shrek''': He's not your true love.
:'''Fiona''': And what do you know about true love?
:'''Shrek''': Well, I-- Uh-- I mean--
:'''Farquaad''': Oh, this is precious. [Chuckling] The ogre has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord.
:[Crowd Laughing]
:'''Farquaad''': An ogre and a princess! [Laughing Continues]
:'''Fiona''': Shrek? Is this true?
:'''Farquaad''': Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now, kiss me! Mmmm!
:'''Fiona''': "By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.
:[Whimpers]
:[Crowd Gasping]
:'''Shrek''': Well, uh, that explains a lot.
:'''Farquaad''': Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both!
:'''Fiona''': No, no! Shrek!
:'''Farquaad''': This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?
:'''Fiona''': No, let go of me, Shrek!
:'''Shrek''': No!
:'''Farquaad''': Don't just stand there, you morons.
:'''Shrek''': Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
:'''Farquaad''': I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!
:'''Fiona''': No! Shrek!
:'''Farquaad''': And as for you, my wife,
:'''Shrek''': Fiona!
:'''Farquaad''': I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I am king!
:[Whistles]
:'''Farquaad''': I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have-- Aaah! Aah!
